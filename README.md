# The Knots ðŸŒ€
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cyclones are irregular wind movements involving closed air circulation around a low pressure centre. This closed air circulation is caused by atmospheric disturbances over and above the earthâ€™s surface, coupled with the earthâ€™s â€˜rotation which imparts to these disturbances a whirling motion.

Cyclones are dangerous and every year many families and properties get affected due to this. We can't stop Mother Nature's Disaster, but we can surely be prepared for it. We aim to solve and help the people by alerting them regarding the presence of cyclones and what's the speed of it and there by saving lives. 

### Our Website THE KNOTS helps people by making them aware about the cyclone and provides safety measure based on the type of category in which the cyclone belongs
